<h4><u>User Story</u></h4>

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

<h4><u>Acceptance Criteria</u></h4>

<p><b>GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input</b></p>

    - #1: WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
          THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

    - #2: WHEN I enter my project title
          THEN this is displayed as the title of the README

    - #3: WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
          THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

    - #4: WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
          THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

    - #5: WHEN I enter my GitHub username
          THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
